<b>Tequila</b> - <i>Adult male</i>
<br>Leg bands: <i>Yellow / Purple</i> - Sep 2014
<br>He preferred to drop heavy rather than light objects into a water tube to raise the water level to reach floating food, and he changed his preference in a follow up experiment where heavy objects were no longer functional

<b>Mojito</b> - <i>Adult male</i>
<br>Leg bands: <i>Red / Green</i> - Sep 2014
<br> We banded and released him because the aviary was full at the time. You can see him in the wild flock with Tequila, Michelada, Cerveza, and Charlie at East Beach and the Santa Barbara Zoo

<br><br><b>Chicha</b> - <i>Adult female</i>
<br>Leg bands: <i>Blue / Red</i> - Jan 2015
<br> We banded and released her. You can see her in the wild flock with Charlie at East Beach

<b>Jugo</b> - <i>Adult male</i>

<br> He always has a leaf or a piece of tape or something in his bill and he likes to put these objects in water

<br><br><b>Refresco</b> - <i>Adult male</i>
<br>Leg bands: <i>Purple / Yellow</i> - Jan 2015
