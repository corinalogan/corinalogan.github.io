<b>Xango</b> - <i>Adult male</i>
<br>Leg bands: <i>Light blue (left leg) / Yellow (right leg)</i> - Banded in Jan 2021
<br>He wins the prize for solving the fewest options on the log puzzlebox - he didn't solve any of the 4 options. He is one the top 2 grackles with the largest body size with a leg length of 52.6 mm

<br><br><b>Flan</b> - <i>Adult female</i>
<br>Leg bands: <i>Orange / Orange</i> - Jan 2021
<br>She was in the top 2 fastest grackles to get through all of the aviary tests - taking less than 4 weeks! She is the lightest grackle, weighing in at 96 grams

<br><b>Churro</b> - <i>Adult male</i>
<br>Leg bands: <i>Silver / Green</i> - Jan 2021

<br><br><b>Tembleque</b> - <i>Adult male</i>
<br>Leg bands: <i>Yellow / Silver</i> - Jan 2021
<br>When he was temporarily in the aviaries, he was the fastest grackle to reverse a color preference - in 39 trials. In the wild, he liked to go toe to toe with the snakes in his territory!

<br><br><b>Polvorones</b> - <i>Adult male</i>
<br>Leg bands: <i>Light blue / Red</i> - Jan 2021
<br>He was the fastest grackle to learn a color preference - in 23 trials

<br><br><b>Chocolate</b> - <i>Adult female</i>
<br>Leg bands: <i>Silver / Silver</i> - Jan 2021

<br><br><b>Alegria</b> - <i>Adult female</i>
<br>Leg bands: <i>Green / Yellow</i> - Jan 2021
<br>Her motto is "slow and steady". She would often participate in only one trial per day. In her fastest test, she took 6 days to complete the log puzzlebox

<br><br><b>Sopapilla</b> - <i>Adult female</i>
<br>Leg bands: <i>Silver / Red</i> - Jan 2021

<br><br><img src="images/PinaDSC_7936sm213.JPG" border=1>
<br><font size=-2>&copy; Corina Logan</a></font>
<br><b>Pi&ntilde;a</b> - <i>Adult female</i>
<br>Leg bands: <i>Yellow / nothing</i> - Feb 2021
<br>She was an eager participator in behavioral choice tests when she was temporarily in the aviaries and quickly completed everything

<br><br><b>Kau</b> - <i>Adult male</i>
<br>Leg bands: <i>Aqua / Red</i> - Sep 2021
<br>

<br><br><img src="images/WachilDSC_8584sm213.JPG" border=1>

<br><b>Wachil</b> - <i>Adult female</i>
<br>Leg bands: <i>Silver / Silver</i> - Sep 2021
<br>

<br><font size=-2>&copy; Corina Logan</a></font>
<br><b>Cuervo</b> - <i>Juvenile male</i>
<br>Leg bands: <i>Yellow / Orange</i> - Oct 2021
<br>He liked to sit close to the aisle to watch the experimenters and after he was released back to the wild, he regularly visited the trap. Was he trying to get back to the aviaries?

<br><br><b>Talingo</b> - <i>Adult male</i>
<br>Leg bands: <i>Orange / Silver</i> - Oct 2021
<br>

<br><br><b>Bacmut bacni</b> - <i>Adult male</i>
<br>Leg bands: <i>Silver / Silver</i> - Nov 2021
<br>

<br><br><b>Xunub</b> - <i>Adult male</i>
<br>Leg bands: <i>Green / Yellow</i> - Nov 2021
<br>He was the slowest grackle to learn (76 trials) a color preference, but a very good sport and always eager to participate. His strategy for learning to reverse a preference was to choose the previously rewarded color (the one that now doesn't have any food in it) for 63 trials in a row!

<br><br><b>Changa</b> - <i>Adult female</i>
<br>Leg bands: <i>Red / Red</i> - Nov 2021
<br>

<br><br><b>Urraca</b> - <i>Adult male</i>
<br>Leg bands: <i>Yellow / Yellow</i> - Nov 2021

<br>

<br><br><b>Tzanatl preciosa</b> - <i>Adult female</i>

<br>The smartest grackle ever tested! Learned a color preference in 21 trials, reversed a color preference in 26 trials, and solved all 4 doors on the puzzlebox

<b>Camote</b> - <i>Adult male</i>

<br><b>Tres Leches</b> - <i>Adult female</i>
<br>Leg bands: <i>Orange / Light blue</i> - Mar 2021

<br><br><img src="images/HeladoLazy213.jpg" border=1>
<br><font size=-2>&copy; Kelsey McCune</a></font>
<br><b>Helado</b> - <i>Adult male</i>
<br>Leg bands: <i>Orange / Red</i> - Mar 2021
<br>He was pretty exploratory and kept trying to solve options on the social learning apparatus that he was not trained to demonstrate. He is the grackle with the longest wing length - 190 mm

<br><br><img src="images/ZapotenegroDSC_7981sm213.JPG" border=1>
<br><font size=-2>&copy; Corina Logan</a></font>
<br><b>Zapote Negro</b> - <i>Adult male</i>
<br>Leg bands: <i>Silver / Light blue</i> - Mar 2021
<br>He has some interesting ideas about how the world works. When habituating to the log puzzlebox, he seemed to think that he had to tip the log over to open one of the doors even though no touching of the log was required. He is the heaviest grackle, weighing in at 209 grams

<br><br><b>Merengue</b> - <i>Adult male</i>
<br>Leg bands: <i>Red / Green</i> - Mar 2021

<br><br><b>Carlota</b> - <i>Adult female</i>
<br>Leg bands: <i>Red / Silver</i> - Apr 2021

<br><br><b>Bu&ntilde;uelo</b> - <i>Adult male</i>
<br>Leg bands: <i>Red / Yellow</i> - Apr 2021
<br>He did a great job on the log puzzlebox and solved all 4 options. He is one the top 2 grackles with the largest body size with a leg length of 52.6 mm

<br><br><b>Dulce de Leche</b> - <i>Adult male</i>
<br>Leg bands: <i>Green / Light blue</i> - Apr 2021
<br>He was in the top 2 fastest grackles to get through all of the aviary tests - taking less than 4 weeks!

<br><br><img src="images/CutuyDSC_8430sm213.JPG" border=1>
<br><font size=-2>&copy; Corina Logan</a></font>
<br><b>Cutuy</b> - <i>Adult female</i>
<br>Leg bands: <i>Green / Red</i> - Dec 2021
<br>She was the slowest grackle to reverse (150 trials) a color preference at this site. Her strategy  was to choose only the left side for 63 trials in a row! But she is a great participator - she could do 10 trials in 5 min (the experimenter is what slowed her down)!

<br><br><b>Quiscalus</b> - <i>Adult female</i>
<br>Leg bands: <i>Yellow / Silver</i> - Dec 2021


<br><br><br><br><b>And a few grackles from Woodland...</b>

<br><br><img src="images/GalandraDSC_7505sm213.JPG" border=1>
<br><font size=-2>&copy; Corina Logan</a></font>
<br><b>Galandra</b> - <i>Juvenile female</i>
<br>Leg bands: <i>Aqua / Red</i> - Sep 2021
<br>We caught her in Woodland, and in January 2022 she was living in Sacramento, 31 km away - quite the traveler!

<br><br><img src="images/KelDSC_8083sm213.JPG" border=1>
<br><font size=-2>&copy; Corina Logan</a></font>
<br><b>Kel</b> - <i>Adult female</i>
<br>Leg bands: <i>Orange / Silver</i> - Sep 2021
<br>We caught her in Woodland in September 2021, and in January 2022 she was living in Sacramento (31 km away). We found her back in Woodland in June 2022 with a fledgling! She is quite the traveler!
