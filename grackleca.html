<b>Xango</b> - <i>Adult male</i>
<br>Leg bands: <i>Light blue (left leg) / Yellow (right leg)</i> - Banded in Jan 2021
<br>He wins the prize for solving the fewest options on the log puzzlebox - he didn't solve any of the 4 options. He is one the top 2 grackles with the largest body size with a leg length of 52.6 mm

<br><br><b>Flan</b> - <i>Adult female</i>
<br>Leg bands: <i>Orange / Orange</i> - Jan 2021
<br>She was in the top 2 fastest grackles to get through all of the aviary tests - taking less than 4 weeks! She is the lightest grackle, weighing in at 96 grams

<br><br><b>Churro</b> - <i>Adult male</i>
<br>Leg bands: <i>Silver / Green</i> - Jan 2021

<br><br><b>Tembleque</b> - <i>Adult male</i>
<br>Leg bands: <i>Yellow / Silver</i> - Jan 2021
<br>When he was temporarily in the aviaries, he was the fastest grackle to reverse a color preference - in 39 trials. In the wild, he liked to go toe to toe with the snakes in his territory!

<br><br><b>Polvorones</b> - <i>Adult male</i>
<br>Leg bands: <i>Light blue / Red</i> - Jan 2021
<br>He was the fastest grackle to learn a color preference - in 23 trials

<br><br><b>Alegria</b> - <i>Adult female</i>
<br>Leg bands: <i>Green / Yellow</i> - Jan 2021
<br>Her motto is "slow and steady". She would often participate in only one trial per day. In her fastest test, she took 6 days to complete the log puzzlebox

<br><br><b>Sopapilla</b> - <i>Adult female</i>
<br>Leg bands: <i>Silver / Red</i> - Jan 2021

<br><br><b>Pi&ntilde;a</b> - <i>Adult female</i>

<br><br><b>Helado</b> - <i>Adult male</i>
<br>Leg bands: <i>Orange / Red</i> - Mar 2021

<br><br><b>Zapote Negro</b> - <i>Adult male</i>
<br>Leg bands: <i>Silver / Light blue</i> - Mar 2021
<br>He has some interesting ideas about how the world works. When habituating to the log puzzlebox, he seemed to think that he had to tip the log over to open one of the doors even though no touching of the log was required. He is the heaviest grackle, weighing in at 209 grams

<br>Leg bands: <i>Red / Green</i> - Mar 2021

<br><br><b>Dulce de Leche</b> - <i>Adult male</i>
<br>Leg bands: <i>Green / Light blue</i> - Apr 2021
