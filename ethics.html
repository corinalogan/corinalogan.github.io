<b><font color="#05256E" size=+2>LAB CODE OF CONDUCT</font></b> 

<br><br><b><font size=+2>Code of conduct for working with subjects</font></b> 
<br>We respect the individuals who collaborate with us to provide us with the data on which our science relies, regardless of their species. Their well being is of utmost importance, and we take extra care when we are fully responsible for them (i.e., when conducting behavioral choice tests in captivity).

<br><br><br><b><font size=+2>My commitment to conducting rigorous research</font></b> 
<br>My goal is to ethically conduct and promote rigorous science. I avoid exploiting myself as a scientist, I facilitate equality and diversity by ensuring that no one is discriminated against when reading my scientific literature, and I make publishing choices that keep funds in academia (see my <a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/6-518/v2" target="blank">paper</a> and <a href="https://www.repository.cam.ac.uk/handle/1810/256835" target="blank">presentation</a> for background). I use the mechanisms of transparency and verifiability to achieve my goal so anyone can evaluate my contributions at every step of the process. 
<li>I only submit articles to <a href="journals.html" target="blank">100% open access journals at ethical publishers</a>
<li>I publish the review histories, datasets, and code
<li>I only review and serve as an editor for articles at 100% open access journals at ethical publishers when the review history is published
<li>I sign my reviews
<li>I <a href="https://github.com/corinalogan/grackles/blob/master/README.md" target="blank">preregister</a> almost all of my research (write the study plan before collecting data) and I submit it for <a href="https://peercommunityin.org/2020/01/15/submit-your-preregistration-to-peer-community-in-for-peer-review/" target="blank">pre-study peer review</a> to <i><a href="https://peercommunityin.org" target="blank">Peer Community In</a></i>
<br<<i>(Updated June 2020)</i> 


<br><br><br><b><font size=+2>Publishing Ethics</font></b>
<br>Before joining my lab, please take a look at my publishing ethics in the previous paragraph. If you are happy to publish according to these ethics on our collaborative projects, then feel free to contact me about the potential to work together.

<br><br>Occasionally, it happens that I became part of a research project before I adopted my current publishing ethics. In these cases, I do not pressure collaborators to publish in particular journals (the bullying stops here). If these collaborators would like to publish the research in a journal that I am not willing to submit to, I remove myself as a co-author.

<br><br>It is important that all authors on a paper deserve the credit. I follow the <a href="http://www.icmje.org/recommendations/browse/roles-and-responsibilities/defining-the-role-of-authors-and-contributors.html#two" target="blank">ICMJE guidelines</a> for  determining when co-authorship is warranted.



<br><br><br><b><font size=+2>Reviewing Ethics</font></b>
<br>If I am invited to review a paper for a journal and/or publisher that is not aligned with my commitment to conducting rigorous science, I either: 
<li>accept the review, write the below text in the Comments to the Authors section, and submit the review. I got this idea from the <a href="https://opennessinitiative.org" target="blank">Peer Reviewers&#39; Openness Initiative</a> and modified it to suit my particular ethics
<li>reject the review and explain why using the text below

<br><br>- - - 
<br>My goal is to ethically conduct and promote rigorous science. I avoid exploiting myself as a scientist, I facilitate equality and diversity by ensuring that no one is discriminated against when reading scientific literature I contribute to, and I keep funds in academia (see my <a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/6-518/v2" target="blank">paper</a> (https://f1000research.com/articles/6-518/v2), <a href="https://www.repository.cam.ac.uk/handle/1810/256835" target="blank">presentation</a> (https://www.repository.cam.ac.uk/handle/1810/256835), and <a href="http://corinalogan.com/ethics.html" target="blank">website</a> (http://corinalogan.com/ethics.html) for background). I use the mechanism of transparency to achieve my goal so anyone can evaluate my contributions at every step of the process.

<br><br>Therefore, I am only willing to review papers that:
<br>1) are going to be published gold open access under a CC-BY license,
<br>2) will publish the review history alongside the paper,
<br>3) are submitted to a journal where 100% of the articles are open access, and
<br>4) are submitted to a journal that is published by an academic non-profit organization, or a for-profit corporation that a) has low or no article processing charges, and/or b) heavily invests profits in academia, and/or c) are working to modernize publishing infrastructure for researchers

<br><br>I am not willing to review this paper at this journal because criteria 2-4 are not met, and it is unclear whether criterion 1 is met.

<br><br>Sincerely,
<br>Corina Logan
<br>Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology

<br><br><br><b><font size=+2>Professional behavior at work</font></b>
<br>All lab members are expected to behave professionally at work.
<li>Be on time
<li>No verbal abuse (e.g., belittling, demanding, accusing, blaming)
<li>Work efficiently and effectively - you are responsible for managing interruptions (i.e., focus on work when you are at work)
<li>Follow all rules to ensure your actions comply with permits, land owner wishes, lab policies, and common courtesy to the grackles and to people 
<li>If you encounter a problem, figure out at least one potential solution when discussing it with team members, and take charge of implementing the solution if you are an appropriate person to do so

<br><br>If someone receives two warnings for breach of professional behavior, they will be removed from the team upon their second warning.

<br><br><br><b><font size=+2>Additional supports</font></b>
<br>I recognize that some lab members require additional supports to safely conduct their work. I strive to work together to develop and implement these supports.

<br><br><br><b><font size=+2>Lab Interpersonal Interactions: harassment-free and welcoming environment</font></b>

<br><br>All members of the lab, along with visitors, are expected to agree with the following code of conduct. We will enforce this code as needed. We expect cooperation from all members to help ensure a safe and welcoming environment for everybody.

<br><br><b>The Quick Version</b>
<br>The lab is dedicated to providing a harassment-free and welcoming experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, or religion (or lack thereof). We do not tolerate harassment of lab members in any form. Sexual language and imagery is generally not appropriate for any lab venue, including lab meetings, presentations, or discussions. (However, do note that we work on biological matters so work-related discussions of e.g., animal reproduction are appropriate.) We value individual differences and strive to create a welcoming environment for lab members.

<br><br><b>The Less Quick Version</b>
<br>Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.

<br><br>Members asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.

<br><br>If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact Corina Logan (corina_logan [at] eva.mpg.de) immediately. If Corina is the cause of your concern, Margaret Tarampi (margaret [at] tarampi.com) is a good informal point of contact; she does not work for Corina or the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology, and has agreed to mediate. For official concerns, please contact the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology&#39;s <a href="http://www.eva.mpg.de/evolution/staff/shannon-mcpherron/index.html" target="blank">Ombudsperson</a> or <a href="https://www.eva.mpg.de/german/karriere/chancengleichheit.html" target="blank">Equal Opportunity Commissioner</a>.

<br><br>We realize that people come from all over the world to work on research projects in our lab, and we strive to make everyone feel welcome. For example, English may not be the native language of many lab members; therefore, we will take the time to go slowly and prioritize understanding over speed or convenience. As well, many lab members are multi-lingual, which can help facilitate communication.

<br><br>We expect members to follow these guidelines at any lab-related event.
