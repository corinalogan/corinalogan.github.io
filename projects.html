<b><font color="#05256E" size=+2> Internships / Bachelors theses / Masters theses on The Grackle Project</font></b>

<br><br>The Grackle Project <b>aims</b> to understand how great-tailed grackles (<i>Quiscalus mexicanus</i>) use behavior to succeed in urban environments. The project began in 2012 and has collected extensive behavioral data in 4 populations across the US. We offer <b>unpaid spring and summer</b> internships and thesis projects for students at any level who are interested in animal behavior research and are skilled at detail-oriented work. As biologists, we understand the importance of diversity and we encourage applications from individuals belonging to groups that are traditionally underrepresented in the sciences. 

<br><br><b><font color="#05256E">Potential projects:</font></b> 
<ol>
<li><b>Student-designed research in animal behavior:</b> You are welcome to use our data to explore your own research questions. Check out the links above to get an idea of the data we have already collected and what we have done with it. 

<br><br><li><b>Are populations on the range edge physiologically different?</b> We collected physiological data (fat score and hematocrit [percentage of red blood cells]) for grackles at three latitudes (Tempe, Arizona; Woodland, California; and Sacramento, California). The student will extract data from various data sheets to make one data sheet, and then analyze the data using a statistical program of their choice to determine whether physiological variables vary with latitude.

<br><br><li><b>How widespread is male parental care?</b> Great-tailed grackles are known to have a mating system where females are the sole builders of the nest and caretakers of the young. However, there is one report from Selander (1970) in which an unmarked male provided parental care to two juveniles in Austin, Texas. We are finding repeated parental care events by multiple individually marked adult males in Tempe, Arizona, and further events in Santa Barbara, California, and San Clemente, California (see <a href="http://corinalogan.com/Preregistrations/gmalecare.html">Folsom et al. 2020</a> for more details in our preregistration). To understand how widespread male parental care might be in this species, the intern will search <a href="https://ebird.org/explore">eBird.org</a> for pictures of this species feeding their young. They will then enter data into a data sheet: the sex of the grackle that is giving the food, what the food is, and where the photo was taken. This project requires making a free profile at <a href="https://secure.birds.cornell.edu/cassso/account/create?service=https%3A%2F%2Febird.org%2Flogin%2Fcas%3Fportal%3Debird&locale=en_US">eBird</a>.

<br><br><li><b>Does great- and boat-tailed grackle foraging behavior vary across their ranges?</b> Great-tailed grackles (<i>Quiscalus mexicanus</i>) and boat-tailed grackles (<i>Quiscalus major</i>) are closely related species, however only the great-tailed grackle is rapidly expanding its geographic range. Could this be due to their different foraging pattens? The intern will begin to answer this question by searching <a href="https://ebird.org/explore">eBird.org</a> for pictures of each species eating. They will then enter data into a data sheet: the sex of the grackle that is eating the food, what the food is, and where the photo was taken. This project requires making a free profile at <a href="https://secure.birds.cornell.edu/cassso/account/create?service=https%3A%2F%2Febird.org%2Flogin%2Fcas%3Fportal%3Debird&locale=en_US">eBird</a>. Note that this project does not have to cover both species - it can focus on only one species if that is preferable.

<br><b><font color="#05256E">Required qualifications:</font></b> 
<li>Interest in learning how to conduct animal behavior research
<li>Must be skilled at detail-oriented work
<li>Ability to work at a computer with an internet connection
<li>A minimum commitment of 50 hours across 10 weeks (2 credits) and enrollment for credit


<br><br><b><font color="#05256E">Students who wish to apply. . . </font></b>
<br><br>Please email Dr. Corina Logan (corina_logan [at] eva.mpg.de) an initial inquiry with:  

<br>1) how you meet the required qualifications
<br>2) your motivation for applying
<br>3) potential research questions (if proposing a student-designed research topic)
<br>4) proposed timeline, number of credits, and hours per week
<br>5) proposed outcome (e.g., a report, thesis, etc.)
<br>6) how you demonstrate the potential to be a strong role model for groups that are traditionally underrepresented in the sciences (e.g., via outreach activities you conducted, groups you held leadership positions in, policies you have been influential in changing, talks you gave, discussions you organized, etc.)

<br><br><b>If Corina confirms that your research interests and proposed timeline are a good fit for the project</b>, then please email Corina your CV (Curriculum Vitae; a researcher's version of a resume. Here is <a href="https://www.careers.cam.ac.uk/applying-for-jobs/cvs-and-cover-letters">advice</a> on how to make one). Candidates who are a good match for the project will then be interviewed
