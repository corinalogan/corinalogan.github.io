<b>What is <font color="#05256E" size=+2>behavioral flexibility</font> and is it a <font color="#05256E" size=+2>mechanism</font> for surviving in new environments?</b> 
<br>Behavioral flexibility, the ability to adapt behavior to new circumstances, is thought to play an important role in a species&#39; ability to successfully adapt to new environments and expand its geographic range. However, flexibility is rarely directly tested in species in a way that would allow us to determine how flexibility works and predict a species&#39; ability to adapt their behavior to new environments. I use great-tailed grackles (an urban bird) as a model to investigate this question because they have rapidly expanded their range into North America over the past 140 years. In Santa Barbara, I found that they are <a href="https://peerj.com/articles/1975/" target="Blank">behaviorally flexible</a> and that flexibility is independent from problem solving ability, problem solving speed</a>, <a href="https://peerj.com/articles/2215/" target="Blank">other behaviors</a>, and <a href="http://rsos.royalsocietypublishing.org/lookup/doi/10.1098/rsos.160247" target="Blank">innovativeness</a>, and that grackles can solve some problems with a similar efficiency to <a href="http://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0103049" target="Blank">New Caledonian crows</a>. 

<br><br>We are currently investigating how great-tailed grackles are able to rapidly expand their geographic range by testing their behavior, immunity, hormones, parasites, and population genetics in three populations from the core of their range to the expanding northern edge. So far, we found that we can <a href="http://corinalogan.com/Preregistrations/g_flexmanip2.html" target="Blank">manipulate flexibility</a> through serial reversal learning and that this manipulation makes individuals more flexible and more innovative in a new context (a puzzlebox). We also found that reversal learning (a measure of flexibility) positively correlates with performance on the <a href="http://corinalogan.com/Preregistrations/g_inhibition.html" target="Blank">go/no go</a> task (a measure of inhibition), and has no relationship with <a href="http://corinalogan.com/Preregistrations/g_inhibition.html" target="Blank">detour</a> performance (a measure of inhibition) or <a href="http://corinalogan.com/Preregistrations/g_causal.html"target="Blank">causal cognition</a> (there was no evidence of causal cognition, though this could be due to our experimental design). Contrary to most bird species studied so far, great-tailed grackles show <a href="http://corinalogan.com/Preregistrations/gdispersal_manuscript.html" target="Blank">male-biased dispersal</a>. We discovered the second case of <a href="http://corinalogan.com/Preregistrations/gmalecare.html" target="Blank">male parental care</a> in great-tailed grackles and are seeing this behavior in multiple locations. The one male-juvenile pair we were able to catch showed that they are not genetically related, indicating that the caring male was not contributing to his direct fitness and instead might perform this behavior as a result of uncertain paternity or as a signal to future mates.


<br><br><b><font color="#05256E" size=+2><a href="https://github.com/ManyIndividuals/ManyIndividuals" target="Blank">ManyIndividuals</a></font></b> 
<br>I co-founded a global network of researchers with field sites to investigate hypotheses that involve generalizing across many individuals. We conduct the same tests in the same way across species to determine whether the results of particular experiments are generalizable beyond that species. We are manipulating behavioral flexibility in species that are successful in human modified environments and in endangered species to determine whether an increase in flexibility improves their success in human modified environments.

<br><br><b><font color="#05256E" size=+2>Code of conduct</font></b> 

<br><b><font size=+1>We conduct open, verifiable, ethical research</font></b>
<br>Our goal is to ethically conduct and promote rigorous research. We avoid exploiting ourselves as scientists, we facilitate equity and diversity by ensuring that no one is discriminated against when reading research outputs, and we make publishing choices that keep funds in academia (see <a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/6-518/v2" target="blank">article</a> and <a href="https://www.repository.cam.ac.uk/handle/1810/256835" target="blank">presentation</a> for background). We use the mechanisms of transparency and verifiability to achieve this goal so anyone can evaluate our contributions at every step of the research process. 

<br><br>All research that generates experimental data starts off as a <a href="https://github.com/corinalogan/grackles/blob/master/README.md" target="blank">registered report</a> (study plan is peer reviewed before data collection/analysis starts) at <a href="https://rr.peercommunityin.org" target="blank">Peer Community in Registered Reports</a>. We share our datasets and code. We follow the <a href="http://www.icmje.org/recommendations/browse/roles-and-responsibilities/defining-the-role-of-authors-and-contributors.html#two" target="blank">ICMJE guidelines</a> to ensure that all authors deserve the credit and that they receive credit where credit is due.

<br><br>If research outputs are disseminated via a journal (rather than only at <a href="https://peercommunityin.org" target="blank">Peer Community In</a>), the journal must have the following features (why? See <a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/6-518/v2" target="blank">Logan 2017</a> and <a href="journals.html" target="blank">Corina's ethical publishing page</a>): 
    <li>Be <a href="journals.html" target="blank">100% open access</a>
   <li>Select articles based on scientific validity, not subjective impact
   <li>Be published by an <a href="journals.html" target="blank">ethical publisher</a> (e.g., non-profit, researcher run) 
   <li>Is not part of a contract where institutes pay to publish open access (e.g., read and publish agreements, transformative agreements - read why these are unethical <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1TUuoHV8yA0TSLUCo0PhrzfR5lwWruZQibKimOoVVJ6E/edit?usp=sharing" target="blank">here</a>) (note: institutes pre-paying APCs in batches at a journal is ok as long as there is no contract)
   <li>The review history must be publicly available
   <li>The article must be published under a CC BY license
   <li>It should be free to publish (no APCs) or very cheap


<br><br><br><b><font size=+1>We respect individuals who participate in our experiments</font></b> 
<br>We respect the individuals who collaborate with us to provide us with the data on which our science relies, regardless of their species. Their well being is of utmost importance, and we take extra care when we are fully responsible for them (i.e., when conducting behavioral choice tests in captivity).


<br><br><br><b><font size=+1>We strive to take anti-racist and anti-sexist action</font></b>
 <li>Selection of new team members is designed to counteract racist/sexist biases (details <a href="https://osf.io/afwre/wiki/home" target="blank">here</a>)
<li>We recognize that some lab members require additional supports to safely conduct their work (as in the <a href="https://vod.video.cornell.edu/media/Safer%20Science%3A%20Strategies%20to%20protect%20at-risk%20researchers%20when%20conducting%20fieldwork/1_noix4lnn" target="blank">Safer Science</a> seminar by Amelia-Juliette Demery and Monique Pipkin). We strive to work together to develop and implement these supports
 <li>We implement learnings from anti-racist and anti-sexist resources such as those from <a href="https://www.fungiloverlab.com/dei" target="blank">Dr. Romero-Olivares lab</a>


<br><br><br><b><font size=+1>We cultivate a harassment-free and welcoming environment</font></b>

</i>

<br><br>All members of the lab, along with visitors, are expected to agree with the following code of conduct. We will enforce this code as needed. We expect cooperation from all members to help ensure a safe and welcoming environment for everybody.

<br><br><b><i>The Quick Version</i></b>
<br>The lab is dedicated to providing a harassment-free and welcoming experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, or religion (or lack thereof). We do not tolerate harassment of lab members in any form. Sexual language and imagery is generally not appropriate for any lab venue, including lab meetings, presentations, or discussions. (However, do note that we work on biological matters so work-related discussions of e.g., animal reproduction are appropriate.) We value individual differences and strive to create a welcoming environment for lab members.

<br><br><b><i>The Less Quick Version</i></b>
<br>Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.

<br><br>Members asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.

<br><br>If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact Corina Logan (corina_logan [at] eva.mpg.de) immediately. If Corina is the cause of your concern, Margaret Tarampi (margaret [at] tarampi.com) is a good informal point of contact; she does not work for Corina or the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology, and has agreed to mediate. For official concerns, please contact the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology&#39;s <a href="http://www.eva.mpg.de/evolution/staff/shannon-mcpherron/index.html" target="blank">Ombudsperson</a> or <a href="https://www.eva.mpg.de/german/karriere/chancengleichheit.html" target="blank">Equal Opportunity Commissioner</a>.

<br><br>We realize that people come from all over the world to work on research projects in our lab, and we strive to make everyone feel welcome. For example, English may not be the native language of many lab members; therefore, we will take the time to go slowly and prioritize understanding over speed or convenience. As well, many lab members are multi-lingual, which can help facilitate communication.

<br><br>We expect members to follow these guidelines at any lab-related event.

<br><br><br><b><font size=+1>Professional behavior at work</font></b>
<br>All lab members are expected to behave professionally at work.
<li>Be on time
<li>No verbal abuse (e.g., belittling, demanding, accusing, blaming)
<li>Work efficiently and effectively - you are responsible for managing interruptions (i.e., focus on work when you are at work)
<li>Follow all rules to ensure your actions comply with permits, land owner wishes, lab policies, and common courtesy to the grackles and to people 
<li>If you encounter a problem, figure out at least one potential solution when discussing it with team members, and take charge of implementing the solution if you are an appropriate person to do so

<br><br>If someone receives two warnings for breach of professional behavior, they will be removed from the team upon their second warning.
