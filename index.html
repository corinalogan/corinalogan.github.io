<b>What is <font color="#05256E" size=+2>behavioral flexibility</font> and is it a <font color="#05256E" size=+2>mechanism</font> for surviving in new environments?</b> 
<br>Behavioral flexibility, the ability to adapt behavior to new circumstances, is thought to play an important role in a species&#39; ability to successfully adapt to new environments and expand its geographic range. However, behavioral flexibility is rarely directly tested in species in a way that would allow us to determine how it works and how we can make predictions about a species&#39; ability to adapt their behavior to new environments. I use great-tailed grackles (a bird species) as a model to investigate this question because they have rapidly expanded their range into North America over the past 120 years. I found that they are <a href="https://peerj.com/articles/1975/" target="Blank">behaviorally flexible</a> and that flexibility is independent from problem solving ability, problem solving speed</a>, <a href="https://peerj.com/articles/2215/" target="Blank">other behaviors</a>, and <a href="http://rsos.royalsocietypublishing.org/lookup/doi/10.1098/rsos.160247" target="Blank">innovativeness</a>, and that grackles can solve some problems with a similar efficiency to <a href="http://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0103049" target="Blank">New Caledonian crows</a>. We are currently investigating how great-tailed grackles are able to rapidly expand their geographic range by testing their behavior, immunity, hormones, parasites, and population genetics in three populations from the core of their range to the expanding northern edge. 

<br><br><b>My commitment to conducting <font color="#05256E" size=+2>rigorous, verifiable research</font></b> 
<br>My goal is to ethically conduct and promote rigorous research. I avoid exploiting myself as a scientist, I facilitate equality and diversity by ensuring that no one is discriminated against when reading my scientific literature, and I make publishing choices keep funds in academia (see my <a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/6-518/v2" target="blank">paper</a> and <a href="https://www.repository.cam.ac.uk/handle/1810/256835" target="blank">presentation</a> for background). I use the mechanisms of transparency and verifiability to achieve my goal so anyone can evaluate my contributions at every step of the process. I only submit articles to <a href="journals.html" target="blank">100% open access journals at ethical publishers</a>, and I publish the review histories and datasets (and usually also R code). I only review and serve as an editor for articles at 100% open access journals at ethical publishers when the review history is published, and I sign my reviews. I preregister my research (write the study plan before collecting data) and I submit it for pre-study peer review at <i>Peer Community In</i>. <i>(Updated May 2019)</i>
