<b><font color="#05256E" size=+2>What is behavioral flexibility and how does it relate to other behaviors?</font></b> 
<br>Behavioral flexibility, the ability to adapt behavior to new circumstances, is thought to play an important role in a species&#39; ability to successfully adapt to new environments and expand its geographic range. However, flexibility is rarely directly tested in species in a way that would allow us to determine how flexibility works and predict a species&#39; ability to adapt their behavior to new environments. I use great-tailed grackles (an urban bird) as a model to investigate this question because they have rapidly expanded their range into North America over the past 140 years. In Santa Barbara, I found that they are <a href="https://peerj.com/articles/1975/" target="Blank">behaviorally flexible</a> and that flexibility is independent from problem solving ability, problem solving speed</a>, <a href="https://peerj.com/articles/2215/" target="Blank">other behaviors</a>, and <a href="http://rsos.royalsocietypublishing.org/lookup/doi/10.1098/rsos.160247" target="Blank">innovativeness</a>, and that grackles can solve some problems with a similar efficiency to <a href="http://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0103049" target="Blank">New Caledonian crows</a>. In Tempe, Arizona, my team and I found that reversal learning (a measure of flexibility) positively correlates with performance on the <a href="http://corinalogan.com/Preregistrations/g_inhibition.html" target="Blank">go/no go</a> task (a measure of inhibition), and is not strongly related with <a href="http://corinalogan.com/Preregistrations/g_inhibition.html" target="Blank">detour</a> performance (a measure of inhibition) or <a href="http://corinalogan.com/Preregistrations/g_causal.html"target="Blank">causal cognition</a>. 


<br><br><b><font color="#05256E" size=+2>How are great-tailed grackles rapidly expanding their range? </font></b> 

<br>Grackles <a href="https://doi.org/10.24072/pcjournal.248"target="Blank">increased their habitat breadth</a> between 1979 and 2019 by moving into more urban, arid environments. This could indicate that they are using behavior to adapt to new environments. We tested this and found that grackles in a recently established population on the edge of their range (Woodland, California) are <a href="https://doi.org/10.32942/X2N30J"target="Blank">more persistent and have a higher variance in flexibility</a> compared with grackles in an older population away from the northern edge (Tempe, Arizona). Therefore, it appears that behavior is involved in facilitating this rapid range expansion.

<br><br><b><font color="#05256E" size=+2>Does flexibility help individuals succeed in human modified environments? The <a href="https://github.com/ManyIndividuals/ManyIndividuals" target="Blank">ManyIndividuals</a> reproducible research program</font></b> 
<br>We found that we can <a href="https://doi.org/10.32942/osf.io/5z8xs" target="Blank">manipulate grackle flexibility</a> through serial reversal learning and that this manipulation makes individuals more flexible and more innovative in new contexts. I co-founded a global network of researchers with field sites to investigate whether we can manipulate flexibility in endangered and successful species and, if so, whether this helps them survive in human modified environments.
